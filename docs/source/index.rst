Scarabée : A Light Water Reactor Lattice Physics Code
=====================================================

Scarabée is a Python library, primarily written in C++, which contains a number
of methods for solving the multi-group formalism of neutron transport equation.
These solvers can be used independently to analyze particular problems of
interest. Additionally, the library contains driver classes that turn Scarabée
into a full lattice physics code, automating the calculations required to model
2D PWR assemblies. It uses a custom HDF5 formatted nuclear data library which
contains cross sections at different temperatures and dilutions for all
provided isotopes. Currently, equivalence in dilution is used for
self-shielding of cross sections.

Scarabée provides students an easy-to-use interface to model various LWR
problems, better understanding reactor physics and the core design process.
